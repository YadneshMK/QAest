# QAest Security and Performance Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Plain Text Password Storage ✅
- Implemented bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds of 10
- Created migration script to hash existing passwords
- All passwords are now securely stored

### 2. Weak Authentication System ✅
- Implemented JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry
- Added proper token validation middleware
- Tokens include user details and are signed with a secret key

### 3. Authorization Bypass ✅
- Added backend role validation with `requireRole` middleware
- All sensitive endpoints now check user permissions
- Implemented role-based access control for admin functions

### 4. Race Conditions ✅
- Implemented file locking using `proper-lockfile`
- All file write operations now use exclusive locks
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff

## High Priority Issues Fixed

### 5. Missing CRUD Operations ✅
- Added PUT endpoint for updating test cases
- Added DELETE endpoint for deleting test cases
- Implemented ownership and permission checks
- Updated frontend to support edit/delete functionality

### 6. No Pagination ✅
- Implemented server-side pagination for test cases
- Added page and limit query parameters
- Frontend updated with pagination controls
- Returns metadata: currentPage, totalPages, hasNextPage, etc.

### 7. User Approval Workflow Bugs ✅
- Fixed notification system for user approvals/rejections
- Added notifications when new users register
- Implemented role change notifications
- All admins receive notifications for pending approvals

### 8. Missing Rate Limiting ✅
- Implemented general rate limiting (100 requests/15 min)
- Auth endpoints limited to 5 requests/15 min
- Creation endpoints limited to 20 requests/hour
- Uses express-rate-limit with proper headers

### 9. Memory Leaks ✅
- Converted all file operations to async/await
- Removed synchronous file operations
- Added global error handlers
- Implemented proper promise handling

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 10. Input Validation ✅
- Implemented express-validator for all user inputs
- Added validation rules for:
  - User registration (username, password strength, email)
  - Login credentials
  - Test case creation
  - Role updates
  - Permission requests
- Added XSS prevention with HTML entity sanitization
- Created sanitization helpers for recursive object cleaning

### 11. Data Operations Efficiency ✅
- Implemented in-memory caching with 5-second TTL
- Added indexing for fast user and test case lookups
- Cache invalidation on writes
- Reduced file I/O operations significantly

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Password Security**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Must contain uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
   - Bcrypt hashing with proper salt rounds

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens with expiration
   - Token validation on every request
   - Fresh user data lookup to prevent stale permissions

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission checks at the API level
   - Ownership validation for modifications

4. **Input Security**
   - Comprehensive validation rules
   - HTML entity encoding for XSS prevention
   - Proper error messages without exposing internals

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Different limits for different endpoint types
   - Skip successful requests for auth endpoints
   - Standard rate limit headers

6. **Error Handling**
   - Global error handlers
   - Graceful error recovery
   - No sensitive information in error messages

## Performance Improvements

1. **Caching**
   - 5-second TTL for read operations
   - Cache invalidation on writes
   - Deep copy to prevent cache pollution

2. **Indexing**
   - Username index for fast login
   - Test case ID index for quick lookups
   - Automatic index rebuilding

3. **Async Operations**
   - All I/O operations are async
   - Proper promise handling
   - No blocking operations

## Remaining Low Priority Items

- UI Polish (loading states, animations)
- Advanced filtering options
- Export functionality
- Bulk operations
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes:

1. **Password Security**: Try logging in with old credentials after running migration
2. **Authentication**: Check JWT tokens in network tab
3. **Rate Limiting**: Make rapid requests to see rate limit messages
4. **Validation**: Try submitting forms with invalid data
5. **Performance**: Monitor response times for large datasets
